# Exams-Project
My final exams project from my time at 3D College

Everything that I have written is in the src folder.
Everything else is for if you want to download and have a look at it yourself.
It was made with npm React, and the way you start the project is by installing the nessecary node modules with npm install
and then using the npm start command in your console
